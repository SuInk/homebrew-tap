  caveats <<~EOS
    Lid-close mode installs a scoped sudoers rule at /etc/sudoers.d/sleepcat
    on first use. Remove it with `brew uninstall --zap --cask sleepcat`.

    To pick up new versions with a plain `brew upgrade`, trust the tap once:
      brew trust suink/tap
  EOS

  # zap rather than uninstall: uninstall also runs on every upgrade, which
  # would force re-authorization after each update.
